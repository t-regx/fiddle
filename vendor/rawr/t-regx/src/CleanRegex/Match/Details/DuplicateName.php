/**
 * There are two strategies to handling duplicate names in
 * groups (and to handling any group, actually, although in
 * non-duplicate names their results are identical).
 *
 * When there are duplicate group names used in a pattern,
 * only the last encountered group will be present in the
 * resulting array, because PHP only keeps unique keys
 * in an array. So even if multiple groups (with duplicate
 * names) matched separate strings, only the last will be
 * present in the result. Thus, it's impossible to distinguish
 * which exact (indexed) group actually matched the named
 * group. It's possible to sometimes "guess" that certain
 * groups definitely didn't match it (if their values and/or
 * offsets are different), but if they're equal (and it's
 * possible that they're equal), then the distinguishment
 * is impossible.
 *
 * So there are two strategies to read a group value.
 * They have their advantages and flaws.
 *
 * - Read a group as it was at compiled pattern
 * - Read a group directly from the runtime result
 *
 * If you read a group at compile time, it becomes
 * possible to uniquely assign an index to a group,
 * by assuming that the first group in the pattern
 * because "the group", and other groups named with
 * the same names are treated as though they aren't
 * named at all. Basically, removing duplicate names
 * from the pattern but the first, if there are any.
 *
 * If you read a group at runtime, it becomes slightly
 * more useful, since "in some cases" you can read the
 * actual group value (not all cases), but you can no
 * longer assign an index to the group (you can't tell
 * which group exactly matched it), you can only tell
 * what value does the named group has, but not which
 * group matched it.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Compile strategy:
 * Pattern "(?<g>one)?(?<g>two)?(?<g>three)?" is treated
 * as "(?<g>one)(two)(three)". We just assume the
 * first indexed group is named, and the other two aren't.
 *
 * Runtime strategy:
 * With pattern "((?<g>one)|(?<g>two))" depending on the
 * subject, only the first or the second group will be matched,
 * we'll know that group "g" was matched either "one" or "two",
 * but we can't tell what index did the group have. We can't
 * distinguish them, because PHP sucks big time.
 *
 * The real explanation:
 *
 * When we run the pattern, and get the runtime result, what
 * information do we really have:
 * - The order of the named and indexed groups - which allows
 * us to assign the first occurrence of the duplicately named
 * group to the first indexed group (but not necessarily the
 * matched group), which allows us to use the index() method,
 * but the group may not be matched, and other group with the
 * same name might have it matched.
 * - The value of the named group, but no means to tell exactly
 * which group it is, which allows us to read the group, but
 * no way to say which index it has.
